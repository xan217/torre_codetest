# FrontEnd app solution

This project was created thinking to give to the job seekers the option to look for jobs based in the companies list. There are 4 main views that do the process. 

##Pages
- The general entrance that shows the 3 entry points for the views basen in the Torre page style (a close one but not exact).
- The search that is not working yet, but should show a list of offers that match with the words given.
- The Companies that shows a list of companies with a general information about them.
- The Job Listing that shows the list of jobs from a selected company. This view should redirects to the Torre site.
- There could be a design of a general description of the job opportunity but is not complete.
